# Longest Common Subsequence
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings...


**Example 1:** <br>
s1 = "abcde", s2 = "ace" <br>
The longest common subsequence here is "ace".

**Example 2:** <br>
s1 = "abc", s2 = "def" <br>
Here we dont have any common subsequence.
