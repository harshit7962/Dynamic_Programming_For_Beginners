# Longest Increasing Subsequence
The problem of longest increasing subsequence is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements  of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order...

**Example1:**<br>
arr = [8,22,9,33,21,50,41,60,80]<br>
The longest increasing subsequence here is [8,22,33,50,60,80] of size 6...
Note that there are other LIS of size 6 as well : [8,9,21,41,60,80] and [8,9,33,50,60,80] etc...
But there is none with length more than 6...
