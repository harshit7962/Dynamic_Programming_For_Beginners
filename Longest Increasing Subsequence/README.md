# Longest Increasing Subsequence
The problem of longest increasing subsequence is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements  of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order...

**Example1:**<br>
arr = [8,22,9,33,21,50,41,60,80]<br>
The longest increasing subsequence here is [8,22,33,50,60,80] of size 6...
Note that there are other LIS of size 6 as well : [8,9,21,41,60,80] and [8,9,33,50,60,80] etc...
But there is none with length more than 6...

## Variations of LIS
1) **Minimum deletions to make array sorted:** Here we need to find the Longest Increasing subsequence and delete all the other numbers to make the array sorted... So simply the result would be size(array) - lis(array)
2) **Maximum sum increasing subsequence:** The idea here is very similar to lis... In lis we keep track of longest subsequence till current index, here we keep track of largest sum till current index...
3) **Maximum Length Bitonic Subsequence:** The problem here is to find the longest subsequence, such that one half of the sequence is increasing and the other is decreasing... Altho perfectly increasing and decreasing can also be a result... The idea here is to find lis of every index and also lds starting from every index... and the final result would be the maximum of lis[i]+lds[i]-1
4) **Building Bridges:** Given cities and bridges to be construted joining city (a,b), we need to find the maximum number of bridges that we can make without them crossing each other... The idea here is to sort our pairs (a,b) in order of a.. Now we find lis using the condition that b should be less than a of next element...
5) **The longest chain:** Given an array of pairs, we need to find longest chain of pairs such that any two pairs (a,b) and (c,d) and (b<c). It is already given that a<b in any pair. The idea again here is to make sort the pairs in order of a and then find lis using the given condn...
