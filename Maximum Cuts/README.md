# Maximum Cuts or Rod Cut Problem
Given a rod of length n units and 3 scales of size a, b and c units each. We need to find the maximum number of cuts we can make such that each cut is either of size a or b or c units...

**Example 1:**<br>
Given n = 5, a=1, b=2, c=3 <br>
The maximum cuts possible can be achieved by 1+1+1+1+1, hence result is 5

**Example 2:**<br>
Given n=23, a=11,b=12,c=13<br>
The maximum cuts possible can be achieved by 11+12, hence result is 2

**Example 3:**<br>
Given n=5, a=2, b=4, c=8<br>
We cannot cut this rod into sizes of 2 or 4 or 8, hence our result is -1...
